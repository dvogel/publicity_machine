publicity_machine - a python framework to grab press releases and load them
into churnalism.

The "churn" package provides the framework. In general, you derive
a scraper from churn.BaseScraper, then invoke it's main() method.

The BaseScraper methods you'd want to override are:

    __init__()    - to set the scraper name and the doc_type to use. Derived
                    scrapers can also define additional commandline arguments
                    here (see prnewswire for an example).
    find_latest() - to grab a list of the latest press releases (usually
                    from an rss feed)
    extract()     - parse html data to pull out the various text and metadata
                    of the press release

The marketwire scraper is probably the simplest example.
